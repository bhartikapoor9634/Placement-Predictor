In this project, the objective is to analyze data of previous batchesâ€™ students and use it to forecast the placement probability of the current batch. In this paper, prediction has been done depending on certain features of a student who joins a college such as Degree Type, Stream chosen in HSC, MBA Specialization and many more. The system is based on SVM, KNN and Random Forest algorithms. The performance of the classification techniques is compared by providing and discussing their expected classification accuracy on testing data, which is visualized using confusion matrices. Techniques and algorithms were implemented using Python programing language utilizing machine learning repositories, prediction results and algorithm performance measures were obtained, and visualized for comparison and discussion.
